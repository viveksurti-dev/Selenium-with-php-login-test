How to Run Selenium PHP Login Automation

1. Install Requirements
   -> Make sure you have [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) installed and running (Apache and ChromeDriver).
   -> Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) if not already installed.

2. Install PHP WebDriver
   -> Open a terminal in the project folder.
   -> Run:
     composer require php-webdriver/webdriver

3. Download ChromeDriver
   -> Download the ChromeDriver version matching your Chrome browser from: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
   -> Extract and place `chromedriver.exe` in a known location (e.g., `C:\chromedriver\chromedriver.exe`).

4. Start ChromeDriver
   -> Open a new terminal window.
   -> Run:
     cd chromedriver-win64
     ./chromedriver.exe --port=9515

5. Start Apache Server
   -> Open XAMPP Control Panel.
   -> Start the Apache module.

6. Access the Application
   -> Place the project folder (`Selenium_With_PHP`) in `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.
   -> Open your browser and go to: http://localhost/selenium_with_php/

7. Run the Selenium Test
   -> In the terminal, navigate to the `test` folder:
        cd test
   -> Run the test script:
        php testLogin.php

8. View Results
   -> The terminal will display the result of each test case (Passed/Failed).

**Notes:**
- Make sure ChromeDriver and your Chrome browser versions are compatible.
- If you change the login credentials in `index.php`, update your test cases
